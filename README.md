## Description
My BackYard is a full stack application designed to act as a handy reference for
homeowners, gardeners or even landscapers as they tend to their yards or gardens. Inspired by
my wife, who loves spending time tending to all of our various plants, there came a point where
she required some sort of note system to help her remember all the information about our
home's ecosystem.

I have designed My BackYard as two components divided into a backend and
frontend that utilizes a REST API for communication between the two components.
At this stage in the application development functionality is limited and represents only a
small portion of the eventual functionality. However, I have placed much of my focus on a backend architecture that
will allow for growth both in scope and demand.

## The Frontend
This front-end client for the My BackYard API is currently under development. This project is in its early stages with very limited functionality. 
This Angular front-end application uses JWTs for authentication to the backend API. A focus will be on responsive design for screens of all sizes.
